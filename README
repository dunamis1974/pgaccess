#==========================================================

pgaccess was originally written by Constantin Teodorescu:

"I dedicate this program to my little daughters Ana-Maria and Emilia and to my
wife for their understanding. I hope they will forgive me for spending so many
time far from them."

pgaccess is currently developed by a new development team. For more information, visit the pgaccess wiki web site - www.pgaccess.org

pgaccess options:

 -dbname              Database name
 -debug               Show debug information
 -dir                 Path to configuration file directory
 -hide                Hide main window (will also disable the splash screen)
 -home                PGACCESS_HOME
 -host                Database host
 -login               Displays login dialog at startup
 -nicepreview         Makes the print preview window for reports nicer.
 -noauto              Disables automatic load of connections at startup
 -noscript            Disables execution of the 'autoexec' script
 -nosplash            Disable splash screen
 -password            Database password
 -pgintcl             Uses pgin.tcl frontend/backend protocol v2 (for 6.4<=PG<=7.3), a pure Tcl-PG interface, instead of a dll/so (overrides PGLIB)
 -pgintcl3            Uses pgin.tcl frontend/backend protocol v3 (for PG>=7.4), a pure Tcl-PG interface, instead of a dll/so (overrides PGLIB)
 -pglib               Path to libpgtcl shared object (dll/so) file
 -pgport              Database port
 -printcmd            Print command to set as default.
 -smlogin             Shrinks the login window to ask for only items not specified on the command line
 -temp                Creates only TEMPorary PgAccess tables so your database doesn't get cluttered by them.
 -username            Database user
 -version             Show version information
 -help                Print this message
 -?                   Print this message

For example, let's say you want to start pgaccess with only a login window.  This would be ideal for creating a shortcut to your program and hide the gory details from your users, provided you have an 'autoexec' Script and it opens a Form with some command menu buttons.  Try:

    pgaccess -login -noauto -hide -host localhost -dbname demo -smlogin

Or, maybe you just want the user to click on the shortcut and login automatically.  Try:

    pgaccess -conn -noauto -hide -host localhost -dbname demo -username yourname -password yourpassword

Perhaps you don't want to stick a bunch of pga_* internal tables into your production database.  Simple, specifiy the creation of TEMPorary tables.  Then be sure to save your work as a PgAckage so the next time you connect you can just load the table and all your saved Queries, Reports, etc., are available.  Try:

    pgaccess -temp
